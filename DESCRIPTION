Description: chromoR provides users with a statistical pipeline for analysing chromosomal interactions data (Hi-C data).It combines wavelet methods and a Bayesian approach for correction (bias and noise) and comparison (detecting significant changes between Hi-C maps) of Hi-C contact maps.In addition, it also support detection of change points in 1D Hi-C contact profiles.
